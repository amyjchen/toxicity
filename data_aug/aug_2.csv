The roundtable was moderated by David Thomas, who for the past decade has studied the impact of race on managers careers.

"I: Ok. So, I am Tonisha and I'm working with--on this project with Dr. Christy Byrd. Um, and thank you all again today for being here. As you may have been told, we're doing a study on how teenagers see race in their schools. Race is something that we may think about a lot, or not at all, or somewhere in between. And people think about race in different ways. Even adults don't agree on what race is or how we should talk about it. We want to know how you all think about it. Um, and there are no right or wrong answers here. And we want you to share your point of view even if it's different from someone else's. So sometimes it's uncomfortable talking about race, so let's try to make it as comfortable as possible by paying attention when people speak, and also by being respectful if you disagree with someone. So, you know, if you disagree, just keep it respectful and give your counterargument. So it's ok to disagree because, like I've stated, a lot of people don't agree on some of these things. Um, remember that everything you will say will be completely confidential, that's why we're using the fake names. Um, and you can stop at any time that you want. And let's start by introducing ourselves. And so give me your name and your grade. The name you just made up.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education. Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing collegelong a kind of symbolic promised landdecried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor.

 And Theo, who had felt sexually stifled by her marriage, is free to pick up strangers on the nights when she and Danny have prearranged their strayings

 The characters new situations flirt with ideas frequently associated with queernessopen marriages, a gay-ish affair, the ability to transition between male and female bodiesbut the amorphousness of their relationship and the heavy emphasis on protecting Danny and Theos union make the ending feel less like a romantic micro utopia than an optimization of heterosexual marriage, one that eliminates the destabilizing threats of new urges and sexual exploration

 Danny and Karls erotic ardor is ultimately domesticated and instrumentalized in the same way that Danny and Theos sex life was, at least temporarily, dedicated to maximizing her chances at getting pregnant

 If we had a better understanding of what drew Danny and Karl to each other, we could better root for their relationship
